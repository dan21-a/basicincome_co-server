## Introduction

Basicincome.co is a #DApp built on <a href="http://ripple.com">Ripple.com</a>. The #DApp is the brainchild of swedish prodigy Johan Nygren, and part of his philosophical work <a href="http://www.resilience.me/">How to Create Resilience</a>. Basicincome.co introduces some new concepts, such as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sosu1YsR_Wo">THE INCENTIVE LAYER</a>, <a href="http://graph.basicincome.co">peer-to-peer dividend pathways</a>, and hints at a future feature called <a href="http://www.resilience.me/whitepaper-decentralised-taxrate-governance.html">decentralized taxRate governance</a>.


## Design


The system is a bit of a hack. It uses Ripple API <a href="https://ripple.com/build/websocket-tool/#subscribe">subscribe</a> to create a dividend-network that mirrors the Ripple Network. This mirror network computes dividends on each transaction, and does all the magic. Each user has to sign in manually once in a while to declare tax.

### basicincome_co.js

manages the websocket between client and server.



### subscribe.js 

creates the mirror network



### dividend_algorithm.js 

does everything else. the script is not finished in this repo



<b>How to boot up:<b>
